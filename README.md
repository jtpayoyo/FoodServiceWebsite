# FoodServiceWebsite
This is a website for the fictitious healthybird food service created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5 and pug files. The homepage displays different greetings on load and is served using Node.js on port 8000. Contact information in the webform is not stored on submission. This was created for course work at SAIT and images were taken from randomuser.me or owned by me.
To run the website:
1.	Open Node.js command prompt and navigate to the FoodServiceWebsite/Website folder.
2.	Run the html files by typing the command "node index-html-5.js"
3.	OR run the pug files with the commands "npm start" or "node index-pug-6.js".
